## malate dehydrogenase
 reversibly catalyzes the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate using the reduction of NAD+ to NADH
## glycine C-acetyltransferase 
an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:acetyl-CoA + glycine {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons } \rightleftharpoons  CoA + 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate
##3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase 
an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:3-mercaptopyruvate + cyanide {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons } \rightleftharpoons  pyruvate + thiocyanate and 3-mercaptopyruvate + thiol {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons } \rightleftharpoons  pyruvate + hydrogen sulfide
##6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase
It is an oxidative carboxylase that catalyses the decarboxylating reduction of 6-phosphogluconate into ribulose 5-phosphate in the presence of NADP.
##Amidophosphoribosyltransferase
an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the conversion of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) into 5-phosphoribosyl-1-amine (PRA)
